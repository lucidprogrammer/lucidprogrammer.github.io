Recently, I deployed the same AI model (ByteDance's LatentSync) on both Paperspace Gradient and Google Cloud Platform to compare these platforms for production ML workloads. This post shares my real-world experience, including platform limitations I encountered and the workarounds I developed.

## The Challenge: Deploying LatentSync at Scale

LatentSync is a GPU-intensive lip-sync model that requires:
- **GPU Resources**: NVIDIA A100 or L4 GPUs for reasonable performance
- **Model Storage**: 5GB+ model weights that need efficient loading
- **File Processing**: Input/output handling for video and audio files
- **API Interface**: RESTful endpoints for production integration

I wanted to compare how two different platforms handle these requirements.

## Platform Overview

### Paperspace Gradient
Paperspace specializes in GPU-accelerated infrastructure for AI/ML workloads. **Gradient** is their managed ML platform - think AWS SageMaker but with a focus on simplicity and GPU accessibility.

**Positioning:**
- Specialized AI infrastructure provider
- Developer-friendly GPU access
- Limited geographical availability (vs AWS/GCP)
- Simpler pricing model

### Google Cloud Platform
GCP offers comprehensive cloud services with strong AI/ML capabilities through **Vertex AI** and **Cloud Run**.

**Positioning:**
- Full-service cloud provider
- Global infrastructure
- Enterprise-grade reliability
- Complex but flexible pricing

## Platform Limitations Discovered

### Paperspace: Infrastructure Tooling Gaps

**Terraform Provider Issues:**
```bash
# The official Terraform provider hasn't been updated in 2+ years
# This makes Infrastructure as Code challenging
terraform {
  required_providers {
    paperspace = {
      source = "Paperspace/paperspace"
      # Last update: 2022 - many features missing
    }
  }
}
```

**CLI Deprecation:**
```bash
# The gradient CLI is deprecated
gradient deployments create --help
# Command not found or deprecated

# New paperspace CLI is disconnected from documentation
paperspace deployments create --help  
# Features don't match what's documented
```

**Volume Management:**
- No visible way to add volumes to deployments via UI
- HuggingFace model integration creates read-only volumes
- Can't download additional models at runtime with read-only mounts

### GCP: Complexity but Flexibility

**Terraform State Management:**
```bash
# More setup required but much more reliable
export TF_STATE_BUCKET="${PROJECT_ID}-terraform-state"
gsutil mb -l ${REGION} gs://${TF_STATE_BUCKET}
gsutil versioning set on gs://${TF_STATE_BUCKET}
```

**Resource Quotas:**
```bash
# GPU quota requests take time but are predictable
# Need to plan ahead for production scaling
gcloud compute project-info describe --project=${PROJECT_ID}
```

## Workaround Strategy: Public Storage Integration

Since Paperspace's volume management was limited, I developed a strategy using public GCS buckets:

### Storage Architecture

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Create public buckets for Paperspace integration
PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"

# Input bucket (public read)
gcloud storage buckets create gs://$PROJECT_ID-latentsync-pspace-in \
  --uniform-bucket-level-access

# Output bucket (public read/write)  
gcloud storage buckets create gs://$PROJECT_ID-latentsync-pspace-out \
  --uniform-bucket-level-access

# Make buckets publicly accessible
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding gs://$PROJECT_ID-latentsync-pspace-in \
  --member=allUsers \
  --role=roles/storage.objectViewer

gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding gs://$PROJECT_ID-latentsync-pspace-out \
  --member=allUsers \
  --role=roles/storage.objectViewer
```

### File Upload Automation

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Upload files and generate URLs for processing
VIDEO_FILE="$1"
AUDIO_FILE="$2"
JOB_ID="job-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"

# Upload to GCS
gsutil cp "${VIDEO_FILE}" "gs://${INPUT_BUCKET}/${JOB_ID}/$(basename ${VIDEO_FILE})"
gsutil cp "${AUDIO_FILE}" "gs://${INPUT_BUCKET}/${JOB_ID}/$(basename ${AUDIO_FILE})"

# Generate public URLs
VIDEO_URL="https://storage.googleapis.com/${INPUT_BUCKET}/${JOB_ID}/$(basename ${VIDEO_FILE})"
AUDIO_URL="https://storage.googleapis.com/${INPUT_BUCKET}/${JOB_ID}/$(basename ${AUDIO_FILE})"
OUTPUT_URL="https://storage.googleapis.com/${OUTPUT_BUCKET}/${JOB_ID}/output.mp4"
```

## Application Architecture Comparison

### Paperspace: FastAPI with Job Queue

Since Paperspace deployments have limitations, I built a more sophisticated wrapper:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, BackgroundTasks
import uuid
import tempfile
import requests

app = FastAPI(title="LatentSync API (Paperspace Version)")

@app.post("/jobs", status_code=202)
async def create_job(
    background_tasks: BackgroundTasks,
    job_request: GcsJobRequest
):
    """Create job with URL-based file handling"""
    job_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    
    # Queue background processing
    background_tasks.add_task(
        process_gcs_job,
        job_id,
        job_request.video_in,
        job_request.audio_in,
        job_request.out
    )
    
    return {"job_id": job_id, "status": "processing"}

async def process_gcs_job(job_id: str, video_in: str, audio_in: str, out_path: str):
    """Download from HTTP URLs, process, upload results"""
    
    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as temp_dir:
        # Download inputs via HTTP
        video_response = requests.get(video_in, stream=True)
        audio_response = requests.get(audio_in, stream=True)
        
        # Process with LatentSync
        cmd = [
            "python", "-m", "scripts.inference",
            "--video_path", local_video_path,
            "--audio_path", local_audio_path,
            "--video_out_path", local_output_path
        ]
        subprocess.run(cmd, check=True)
        
        # Upload result via HTTP PUT
        with open(local_output_path, 'rb') as f:
            requests.put(out_path, data=f, headers={'Content-Type': 'video/mp4'})
```

### GCP: Simpler Integration

```python
from google.cloud import storage
import tempfile

def handle_job(job_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Direct GCS integration with service account auth"""
    
    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as temp_dir:
        # Download from GCS with native client
        download_from_gcs(job_data["video_in"], local_video_path)
        download_from_gcs(job_data["audio_in"], local_audio_path)
        
        # Process with LatentSync (same)
        process_video(local_video_path, local_audio_path, local_output_path)
        
        # Upload to GCS with native client
        upload_to_gcs(local_output_path, job_data["out"])
```

## Deployment Process Comparison

### Paperspace: Manual UI Process

```dockerfile

resource "google_cloud_run_v2_service" "latentsync" {
  name     = "latentsync-production"
  location = var.region

  template {
    scaling {
      min_instance_count = 0
      max_instance_count = 10
    }
    
    containers {
      image = var.container_image
      
      resources {
        limits = {
          cpu    = "4"
          memory = "16Gi"
          "nvidia.com/gpu" = "1"

  }'
```

## Decision Framework

### Choose Paperspace When:
- **Prototyping** and experimentation phase
- **Simple deployments** without complex infrastructure needs
- **Cost sensitivity** for GPU compute
- **Small team** without DevOps expertise
- **Short-term projects** with manual management acceptable

### Choose GCP When:
- **Production deployments** requiring enterprise features
- **Infrastructure as Code** is mandatory
- **Global availability** needed
- **Complex integrations** with other cloud services
- **Team expertise** in cloud-native technologies
- **Long-term scalability** and maintenance considerations

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Platform Maturity Matters
Paperspace's focus on AI/ML is appealing, but gaps in infrastructure tooling create operational challenges at scale.

### 2. Workarounds Have Costs
My public GCS bucket workaround for Paperspace added complexity and potential security concerns.

### 3. Developer Experience vs Production Needs
Paperspace excels at developer experience but falls short on production operational requirements.

### 4. Total Cost of Ownership
While Paperspace has lower compute costs, operational overhead can increase total project costs.

### 5. Lock-in Considerations
GCP's comprehensive tooling creates more lock-in but also provides more capabilities.

## Conclusion

Both platforms have their place in the ML deployment ecosystem:

**Paperspace** is excellent for **research, prototyping, and simple production deployments** where developer velocity matters more than operational sophistication.

**GCP** is better for **enterprise production deployments** requiring comprehensive infrastructure management, global scale, and integration with broader cloud ecosystems.

For my LatentSync deployment, I ultimately chose GCP for production due to:
- Superior Infrastructure as Code support
- More sophisticated auto-scaling and monitoring
- Global availability and enterprise-grade reliability
- Comprehensive cost management tools

However, I continue to use Paperspace for rapid experimentation and proof-of-concept work where its simplicity shines.
